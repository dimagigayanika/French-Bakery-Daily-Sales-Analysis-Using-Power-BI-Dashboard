# French Bakery Sales Analysis

## Project Overview

I'm excited to share insights from The French Bakery Sales Analysis Dashboard! 🥐📊 This project focuses on analyzing sales data to gain a comprehensive understanding of the restaurant's performance. 💼📈

By delving into the data, I aimed to uncover sales trends, identify key factors influencing sales, and make data-driven decisions to improve overall sales performance within the restaurant. 🥪📊

Data used: [Kaggle Link for Bakery Daily Sales Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/matthieugimbert/french-bakery-daily-sales?select=Bakery+sales.csv) 

The dataset belongs to a French bakery. The dataset provides the daily transaction details of customers from 2021-01-01 to 2022-09-30. Leveraging the power of Power BI, I created a comprehensive dashboard that provides a visual representation of key sales metrics, product performance, and peak performance. 🕒📈
